# plugin.video.cb20
A kodi plugin for streaming cams from chaturbate.com. Works with all kodi Nexus releases (20).

Tested on Android (Fire TV) and Windows, should work fine with other Linux systems. Not available in a kodi repository, so use "Install from ZIP" in kodi and point to the zip file to install.

## Features

- Listing of cams for all main categories
- Pagination for listings (set cams per page and type of listing in settings)
- Search for cam (exact name and fuzzy search)
- Favourites list (with backup/restore function. Set path in settings first!)
- When streaming a cam use info button for additional info about the room like topic, goal, viewers etc. (if available)

## Recommended settings

- Tested with Estuary skin only
- "Info wall" is the recommended view for listings as you get a little more details about the cam

## Todo

- multi language (english only for the moment)

Hope you enjoy!

(A version for stripchat with similar features available in other repository)
