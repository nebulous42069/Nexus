2.2.1 - Added the option to view and manage data for multiple debrid accounts via one location. This should make it a little easier managing data for users with multiple debrid accounts. Removed Seren add-on due to increased Trakt API requests. Any add-on that supports custom keys has been updated to work accordingly. Added a changelog and Restore All Add-ons to Default option under 'Advanced' so users, if the wish to do so, can restore system to default settings prior to removing the add-on. This was already included in the revoke process but this makes it a little more clear. Bug fixes and clean up

2.2.0 - Added auto-sync services for both Trakt and Debrid. A section to change your backup directory has been added to the settings menu. Numerous changes and bug fixes from predecessor Debrid Manager.

2.1.9 - Initial Release. Added Trakt support and changed name from Debrid Manager to Account Manager. Added new API keys.
